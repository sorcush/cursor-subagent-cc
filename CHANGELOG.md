## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- add models.json as the single source of truth for coder/reviewer models
- read coder model id from models.json in cc-delegate.sh
- read reviewer model id from models.json in cr-delegate.sh
- add gen-changelog.sh to generate a Keep a Changelog section from commits
- add update-changelog.sh for idempotent replace-in-place changelog writes
- wire changelog generation and models drift-check into make release
- add sync-models.sh (config validation + templated-field regeneration)
- add marker-span regeneration, --check, and write atomicity to sync-models.sh
- roll out models.json markers/dynamic reads, fix stale GPT-5.5 references

### Changed
- add changelog + per-agent model config design spec
- revise changelog/model-config spec per Grok 4.5 review
- fix changelog idempotency and remaining spec contradictions
- fix e2e-probe marker defect and tighten remaining spec ambiguities
- fix changelog insert-point bug and complete marker inventory
- log cursor-reviewer effectiveness for the 4-round spec review
- add implementation plan for changelog tracking + model config
- fix plan's scratch-clone verification script (dirty-tree trap)
- guard the dynamic --model probes against hardcoded regressions
- list the new test files in README's Tests section

### Fixed
- correct update-changelog.sh section-replacement ordering bug
- use // empty in jq -er probes so a missing model id fails loudly instead of passing the literal string null
- unify atomic writes across sync-models.sh, enforce ASCII labels, guard release pipe
